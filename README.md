Sieve of Eratosthenes
=====================

This is my answer to a really cool coding exercise I received as a part of an interview process. 

Here are the instructions:  
__“You are given a function 'secret()' that accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer. In your favorite programming language, write a command-line program that takes one command-line argument (a number) and determines if the secret() function is additive [secret(x+y) = secret(x) + secret(y)], for all values x and y, where x and y are prime numbers less than the number passed via the command-line argument.”__

In the interest of giving full disclosure (and credit), I poked around and found the algorithm written in PHP [here](http://www.livelywebdesign.com/blog/2012/06/the-sieve-of-eratosthenes-in-php/) but wrote it in Ruby to give myself a bit of a challenge. I do not know Ruby and this is the first thing I've ever written with it. I'm glad I chose to use Ruby. It's pretty awesome.
